  "summary": "Frontend changes add explicit rendering of an incoming-call prompt in CallSurface, wire Answer/Decline to backend mutations with toast/error handling, and update WebRTC hook structure to buffer/process signals. Backend changes are truncated and do not provide enough evidence that Answer/Decline mutations correctly transition both participants’ call states as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Clicking “Decline” moves the callee’s call status to #none and clears the caller’s call status back to #none; clicking “Answer” transitions both participants to #inCall (and WebRTC starts only after callee answers).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows frontend wiring for answer/decline, but the backend implementation that must mutate both participants’ call states is not shown (backend/main.mo is truncated before any answerCall/declineCall/endCall logic is visible). Without evidence of backend state transitions for both users, this requirement cannot be verified as implemented.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (truncated; shows type/state definitions and start of initiateCall only)",
        "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts (calls actor.answerCall/declineCall/endCall, but does not prove backend behavior)"
